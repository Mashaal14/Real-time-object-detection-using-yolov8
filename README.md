# Real-time-object-detection-using-yolov8
Implemented a real-time object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. Used a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect and label multiple objects in live video feed or images. Made an interface and it detected multiple objects on realtime including cell phone, person, pizza, couch, bed, dog, and cats etc.
